# cpaint (Character Painter)
cpaint is a WinAPI application designed to facilitate the creation of assets, such as avatars, for a virtual space where users can congregate and participate in various activities.

I'm currently developing an application called cpaint, short for "Character Painter," using the WinAPI framework. This project aims to create assets such as avatars for a virtual space where people can gather and engage in various activities. It's an experimental endeavor focused on generating the necessary resources and images for this virtual environment.

At its current stage, cpaint allows users to draw and save their creations as PNG files. However, this is just the initial iteration of the application, and there's still much work to be done for future improvements.

The envisioned virtual space, which I mentioned earlier, is intended to function as a metaverseâ€”an immersive digital realm where users can interact and explore.

An example asset created using cpaint is available for demonstration:
